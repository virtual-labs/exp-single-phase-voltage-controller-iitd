### Procedure

a) Circuit formulation:
<br>

1. Connect the circuit to form the AC Voltage Controller by selecting one of the two options

2. 
    a). If all connections are correct then click on “NEXT” button and proceed for experimentation.<br>
    b). If connections are wrong. Press the “RESET” button and reconnect the terminals to create correct circuit.

b) Operating the circuit: 
<br>

1) Select the type of AC Voltage controller and vary the firing angle (α : 0&#176; to 180&#176;).<br>
2) Press “PLOT” button to simulate the circuit and observe various waveforms.<br>
3) Change “α” to observe the waveforms at different operating conditions.<br>


c) Performance analysis of the circuit: 
 <br>

1) Set the values of input source voltage (VS), load and firing angle (α : 0&#176; to 180&#176;).
2) Select the “ICONS” in sequence to analyse and understand the circuit operation and its performance.
3) Follow the instructions given in respective experiment slide and press the “RECORD” button to fill the observation table. Using these observations plot various performance characteristics.
