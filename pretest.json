      "answers": {        
        "a": "Two anti-parallel SCR",
        "b": "TRIAC",
        "c": "Two anti-parallel Diodes",
        "d": "None of the above"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 1",
        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 3: Diodes are uncontrolled devices and hence can’t be used for getting control on output voltage.",

      "question": "2. The DC component in asymmetrical AC voltage controller with SCR controlling in positive half cycle and Diode conducting in negative half cycle will be",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Positive",
        "b": "Negative",
        "c": "Zero",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 1",
        "b": "Explanation 2: SCR will control load voltage during positive half cycle while diode will allow complete negative half cycle. Hence, DC or average voltage will be negative.",
